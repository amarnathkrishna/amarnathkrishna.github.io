//NodeMCU to GScript data pushing documentation:

12 June 2018:
Every 1 minute, nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets : successful
Every 30 seconds, nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets : successful

Every 30 seconds nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets on 2G: successful, but takes 35-37 seconds for every iteration.
Every 30 seconds nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets on 3G: successful, but takes 32-33 seconds for every iteration.

 GScript uses WifiClientSecure library.

 ESP.restart()/ESP.reset()

 Currently using multiple if/else ladder to scan through RFID tags. 

 Soldered new components onto perforated board:
 1)only NodeMCU and RFID --> dummy data uploaded into GSheet using GScript
 2)NodeMCU+RFID+Moisture Sensor --> data uploaded into GSheet 
 3)all components soldered, connected to ReapBenefit Wifi --> Data uploaded into GSheet

Currently, Hydration Meter in the ground floor waterless urinal is working with ReapBenefit wifi.

Due to huge if-else ladder, and possible redundancy in code, looking at alternate methods to store RFID tag IDs.
Use array/list to match scanned tagID to the stored tagID.
