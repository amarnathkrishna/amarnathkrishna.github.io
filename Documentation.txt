//NodeMCU to GScript data pushing documentation:

12 June 2018:
Every 1 minute, nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets : successful
Every 30 seconds, nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets : successful

Every 30 seconds nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets on 2G: successful, but takes 35-37 seconds for every iteration.
Every 30 seconds nodemcu pushes dummy data into Google Sheets on 3G: successful, but takes 32-33 seconds for every iteration.

 GScript uses WifiClientSecure library.

 ESP.restart()/ESP.reset()

 Currently using multiple if/else ladder to scan through RFID tags. 

 Soldered new components onto perforated board:
 1)only NodeMCU and RFID --> dummy data uploaded into GSheet using GScript
 2)NodeMCU+RFID+Moisture Sensor --> data uploaded into GSheet 
 3)all components soldered, connected to ReapBenefit Wifi --> Data uploaded into GSheet

Currently, Hydration Meter in the ground floor waterless urinal is working with ReapBenefit wifi. 

14 June 2018:
Due to huge if-else ladder, and possible redundancy in code, looking at alternate methods to store RFID tag IDs.
Use array/list to match scanned tagID to the stored tagID. 

ESP8266 uses 2.4Ghz frequency for wifi. 

18 June 2018:
To turn off wifi after use, either use ESP.deepSleep(25000, WAKE_RF_DEFAULT)
or use WiFi.mode(WIFI_OFF).
On the internet, it is found that using Wifi.mode gives 70mA, whereas ESP.deepSleep uses 14mA.
So WiFi.mode does not completely turn off the wifi radio.
For more power saving mode, use  Wifi.forceSleepBegin()
You can use WiFi.disconnect() too, but there are instances that erases the SSID and password.

PCB fabrication on perforated board. 

21 June 2018:
Code updation - No preloadeed authorized cards on NodeMCU memory. Reading any MIFARE RFID Card, and upload the data to google sheets. 
Better since it reduces memory usage in NodeMCU and handling of userID is in the backend.
Uses the example code of ReadNUID available in the examples. 

Existing system has been in test for 3 weeks. Average value of 450 obtained. 

22 June 2018:
GPIO 9 & 10 can be used for input, if all digital inputs are occupied.
PIR sensor used in place of RFID to trigger circuit.

25 June 2018:
PIR sensor in place of RFID tag.
Detects motion and triggers moisture sensor.
